## Paper Format

The template both exemplifies and contains paper format guidelines. These are also available [here](https://acl-org.github.io/ACLPUB/formatting.html).

For ARR submissions, references and appendices should be included in the pdf for the paper, but do not count towards the page limit.

Some key items for first time authors:
- [ ] Use the template
- [ ] Respect the page limit for the paper type
- [ ] Ensure the submission is anonymized

## Anonymization and Citation

Please refer to [this page](https://www.aclweb.org/adminwiki/index.php?title=ACL_Policies_for_Submission,_Review_and_Citation) for the ACL policies for submission, review and citation. Most of this information is also covered in the template and format guidelines linked above.

## Reproducibility

The below reproducibility checklist is provided to help authors improve the reproducibility of their work; submissions are not required to meet all criteria listed and the list of criteria is not exhaustive. This checklist is based on the one from ACL-IJCNLP 2021, which in turn is based on previous versions from NAACL-HLT 2021 and previous versions from Dodge et al and Joelle Pineau.

The paper should include:
- For all reported experimental results:

- [ ] A clear description of the mathematical setting, algorithm, and/or model
- [ ] A link to (anonymized, for submission) downloadable source code, with specification of all dependencies, including external libraries
- [ ] A description of the computing infrastructure used
- [ ] The average runtime for each model or algorithm, or estimated energy cost
- [ ] The number of parameters in each model
- [ ] Corresponding validation performance for each reported test result
- [ ] A clear definition of the specific evaluation measure or statistics used to report results

- For all results involving multiple experiments, such as hyperparameter search:
- [ ] The exact number of training and evaluation runs
- [ ] The bounds for each hyperparameter
- [ ] The hyperparameter configurations for best-performing models
- [ ] The method of choosing hyperparameter values (e.g., manual tuning, uniform sampling, etc.) and the criterion used to select among them (e.g., accuracy)
- [ ] Summary statistics of the results (e.g., mean, variance, error bars, etc.)

- For all datasets used:
- [ ] Relevant statistics such as number of examples and label distributions
- [ ] Details of train/validation/test splits
- [ ] An explanation of any data that were excluded, and all pre-processing steps
- [ ] For natural language data, the name of the language(s)
- [ ] A link to a downloadable version of the dataset or simulation environment
- [ ] For new data collected, a complete description of the data collection process, such as ownership / licensing, informed consent, instructions to annotators and methods for quality control

## Ethics

Authors are encouraged to include in the paper a statement of [ethical considerations](https://www.aclweb.org/adminwiki/index.php?title=ACL_Resolutions#March_5.2C_2020), including those related to collection and annotation of data and considerations of bias, potential for misuse or harm to vulnerable populations relating to any research results.
