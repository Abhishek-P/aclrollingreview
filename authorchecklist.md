Submissions that violate the requirements in the call for papers will be desk rejected. This checklist supplements the call for papers.

## OpenReview Profiles

All authors must have complete OpenReview profiles. Please ensure profiles are complete before submission. You may refer to [this tutorial](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1kJeoAfwbnFapUN0ySLSoOm11-2odz48DGS1DEzNs03k/edit?usp=sharing).

## Paper Format

The template and guidelines are available from [here](https://acl-org.github.io/ACLPUB/formatting.html).

For ARR submissions, references and appendices should be included in the pdf for the paper, but do not count towards the page limit.

Some key items for first time authors:
- Use the template
- Respect the page limit for the paper type
- Ensure the submission is anonymized
- Supplemental materials (including appendices) should be truly supplemental; a reader should be able to understand the work from the paper alone


## Anonymization and Citation

Please refer to [this page](https://www.aclweb.org/adminwiki/index.php?title=ACL_Policies_for_Submission,_Review_and_Citation) for the ACL policies for submission, review and citation. Most of this information is also covered in the template and format guidelines linked above.

## Responsible NLP Research

Responsible NLP research means (among other things) taking into account issues related to ethics and to reproducibility. We provide a checklist, with guidelines and explanation, for [responsible NLP research](https://aclrollingreview.org/responsibleNLPresearch). The completed checklist should be uploaded alongside the submitted paper, as a separate PDF upload.

In addition:
- Authors are encouraged to devote a section of their paper to concerns of the ethical impact of the work and to a discussion of broader impacts of the work, which will be taken into account in the review process. This discussion may extend into a 5th page (short papers) or 9th page (long papers).  
- Authors are encouraged to include [data sheets](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2019/01/1803.09010.pdf) and [model cards](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3287560.3287596) in supplemental material, as appropriate.
