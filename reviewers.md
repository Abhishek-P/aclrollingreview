## What are the responsibilities of an action editor?

Each month, after the submission deadline, action editors who are available that month will be automatically assigned submissions. The action editor will first confirm they have no conflict of interest with each submission. Then, they will quickly check the submission for any major violations in formatting or other factors and desk reject the submission if it is in violation. The action editor will then be presented with a list of reviewers automatically suggested. The action editor will choose reviewers, using this automatic suggestion as a base. This will take place within 7 days of the paper submission deadline.

Each month, starting around 24 days after the submission deadline, the action editor will remind any reviewer who has not yet completed their review.

Each month, between 30 and 35 days after the submission deadline, the action editor will read the reviews, discuss with the reviewers if necessary, and:
* Summarize the review results in a meta-review.
* Perform a compliance check, checking the paper meets formatting and other requirements.

So, action editors will want to be especially available from the 10th to the 20th of each month.

## What is the time commitment for action editors?
An initial term of one year, renewable. We will have a centralized system that keeps track of “review balance”, how much reviewing people have done, and tries to distribute it equitably. In addition, some people prefer to handle many papers at a time as opposed to a few every month. Thus, at the beginning of the monthly reviewing cycle, action editors will have a chance to specify how many papers they would like to handle. In addition, we will add the ability of action editors to indicate that they are on vacation or otherwise unavailable.
