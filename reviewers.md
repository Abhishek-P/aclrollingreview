## What are the responsibilities of a reviewer?
Each month, around 7 days after the submission deadline, reviewers will receive up to 3 submissions to review. Reviewers should immediately check that they have no conflict of interest with their assigned submissions. Reviews should be completed by 30 days after the submission deadline.
Each month, around 30 days after the submission deadline, the action editor will read the reviews and discuss with the reviewers if necessary. Reviewers should be responsive during this time.
So, reviewers will want to be especially available from the 15th to the 22nd of each month.
