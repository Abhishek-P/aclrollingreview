# Frequently Asked Questions for Authors

## Submission and Review

**Q**: How does submission, review and resubmission to ARR work?<br>
**A**:
- When you have a paper ready, you submit to ARR. You then receive reviews.
- You consider your reviews. 
  - If you would like to make improvements to your paper, you do, and then you resubmit your paper to ARR, and provide a response to the previous round of reviews. You then receive reviews from the previous round reviewers and action editor, if available (note that you can request new reviewers under certain circumstances).
  - If you would like to submit your paper+reviews to a publication venue (e.g. a conference), then you do that. The publication venue will make an accept/reject decision for your paper. If your paper is rejected, you may still submit your paper+reviews to other publication venues.
See the questions below for more information.

**Q**: What information do I have to provide to submit?<br>
**A**: See the link to submit to the next deadline, below. Note that some of the fields are only required for _resubmissions_.

**Q**: I have reviews. How do I respond?<br>
**A**: You respond to reviewers by making a _resubmission_. In the submission form, if you are making a _resubmission_, you should: a) provide the URL of your previous submission; b) upload the PDF of your previous submission; and c) upload a single PDF of your response to the previous round of reviews (for example, indicating how you modified the paper to answer reviewers' questions).

**Q**: Why didn't I receive my reviews on the 21s of the month as promised?<br>
**A**: 21 is the earliest date to receive reviews. Unfortunately, we cannot guarantee this as it also depends on the availability of qualified reviewers who reviews the papers. ARR is unlike a regular conference setup and we donâ€™t release all the reviews at the same time. Rather, we release it as soon as it is available. Having said that, we are working hard to make this process more smooth in the upcoming months and reduce any delay in the future.

**Q**: What should I do if my reviews are unfair or extremely low quality? <br>
**A**: If you feel that you need a new reviewer or action editor for your paper, there are fields in the submission form (starting September 2021) where you can request one or more reviewers or the action editor to be replaced, and justify your request. These requests will be considered seriously and either accepted or denied based on their appropriateness.

**Q**: I want to submit my paper+reviews to a publication venue. How?<br>
**A**: *After* you receive your reviews, you will indicate your interest in submitting to ACL through the [Paper+Review Submission Form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=9028kaqAQ0OMdrEjlJf7WXcpizsAwgRHnquEMJ-wjU5UMzZSQ042N0JXQUtaMTJNSDlSR0JRVDZPSS4u). 

**Q**: If I submit early, can I update my submission before the deadline?<br>
**A**: Yes.

**Q**: Does ARR import reviews from other publication venues? <br>
**A**: No, ARR is a self-contained review system and all reviews are done within ARR. We do not import reviews that were done by other venues.

**Q**: Should all authors be registered on OpenReview when submitting to ARR?<br>
**A**: In order for ARR to calculate conflicts of interest correctly, every author should have an OpenReview profile that is complete and up to date.

**Q**: I submitted to ICLR, but want to withdraw my paper to submit to ARR. This withdrawal will cause my paper to become deanonymized. Is that OK? <br>
**A**: We follow the same policy as [NAACL 2021](https://2021.naacl.org/faq/). So:
-  if your paper was posted to arXiv before the one month anonymity period required before submission to ARR, and withdrawn from ICLR within that time period, then you could submit it to ARR
- if your paper was not posted to arXiv but was deanonymized as a result of withdrawal from ICLR, you'd have to wait a month to submit to ARR

**Q**: How can I withdraw my submission?<br>
**A**: You can withdraw your submission at any time by logging into OpenReview, clicking into your submission and then clicking the "trash can" icon in the top right. Note that per the CFP, any submission withdrawn more than 48 hours after the submission deadline cannot be resubmitted before the second subsequent ARR cycle.

**Q**: I have further questions about ARR submission, where do I contact?<br>
**A**: Please contact: `support@aclrollingreview.org`

## Anonymity Requirement

**Q**: When am I allowed to post a non-anonymous preprint?<br>
**A**: Please see the [Call for Papers](/cfp) for a detailed policy. If you post a non-anonymous preprint, you will be asked to provide the URLs in the submission form. You can _always_ host an anonymous preprint in the ARR system itself, there's a simple checkbox in the submission form.

**Q**: Can a paper be submitted to a non-archival venue during the anonymity period given that the paper, if accepted will be presented at the workshop during the anonymity period?<br>
**A**: The ACL and ARR anonymity policies do not forbid you from talking in small venues about your work, but be careful not to publish a non-anonymized draft of the work and please do not publicize it widely (e.g. on social media).

**Q**: Which are acceptable anonymized links for submission of Supplementary materials?<br>
**A**: You can create a throwaway github account and put the anonymized code there, or use other anonymization services as well, e.g., : 1) [Anonymous GitHub](https://anonymous.4open.science/) and 2) [ANONYM SHARE](https://anonymshare.com/).

## Reviews for Data

**Q**: The submission form has a question asking if I agree for the anonymized metadata associated with my submission to be included in a publicly available dataset. What is this?<br>
**A**: The ACL Exec has approved the creation of [an opt-in corpus of submissions and reviews](https://aclweb.org/adminwiki/index.php?title=Review_Data_Collection_at_*ACL). This corpus is being assembled by a group separate from the ARR editorial team. The review meta-data associated with your submission, i.e. scores, anonymous reviewer identifiers etc., will only be included if both you and the reviewers agree. Submission and review texts are not included in this consent and are handled separately.
