# Frequently Asked Questions for Authors

**Q**: Does ARR import reviews from other publication venues? <br>
**A**: No, ARR is a self-contained review system and all reviews are done within ARR. We do not import reviews that were done by other venues.


**Q**: What should I do if my reviews are unfair or extremely low quality? <br>
**A**: If you feel that you need a new reviewer or action editor for your paper, there is a place in the review form (starting September 2021) indicating such. This option should only be used in extreme cases, but these requests will be considered seriously and either accepted or denied based on their appropriateness.

**Q**: I want to submit my paper to ACL ARR on the 15th of September and I'd like to submit it for the ACL 2022 conference, but I can't find where should I specify the venue that I'm interested in submitting it to. How do I select the venue?<br>
**A**: *After* you receive your reviews (i.e. in late October), you will indicate your interest in submitting to ACL through the [Paper+Review Submission Form](https://airtable.com/shrVEN1Tlr8VAEegG). There is nothing that you need to do in September.

**Q**: If I submit early, can I update my submission before the deadline?<br>
**A**: Yes.

**Q**: I have further questions about ARR submission, where do I contact?<br>
**A**: Please contact: `support@aclrollingreview.org`

# Anonymity Requirement

ACL Rolling Review follows the [ACL Policies](https://www.aclweb.org/adminwiki/index.php?title=ACL_Policies_for_Submission,_Review_and_Citation)
regarding anonymity.

> *ACL conferences and TACL require that submissions be anonymized. A submission will not be considered anonymized if the authors post (or update) a non-anonymized preprint version within an anonymity period lasting from 1 month before the submission deadline until the time of notification (or withdrawal). Submissions will be rejected if not properly anonymized.

The "notification (or withdrawal)" phrase refers to notification of acceptance/rejection from a *ACL conference (or workshop). This means that ARR submissions must remain anonymized until a conference or workshop has accepted or rejected, or until the submission is withdrawn.

If authors would like to post a non-anonymous preprint or otherwise deanonymize their submission, they will have to withdraw their submission from ARR, a one step process in OpenReview. Once a submission is withdrawn, it is removed from that month's reviewing pool. Authors may then make a new submission (subject to the one month anonymity waiting period) which would potentially go to a new AE and new reviewers.

Please note that it is possible to publish a preprint anonymously as part of the ARR submission process.
