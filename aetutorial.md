AE Guide to meta-reviewing and Additional Resources

Action Editors play a central role in making the ARR process smooth and in ensuring that the reviews are of high quality and provide constructive feedback to the authors. In other words, it is the job of the AEs to make sure that each ARR submission receives (at least) three high-quality reviews by the time the reviews are scheduled to be released to the authors. As the job of AEs is to ensure the high quality of the reviews, please also thoroughly read the [guidelines for reviewers](https://aclrollingreview.org/reviewertutorial) in addition to reading each paper.

After performing a compliance check for a submission and assigning the reviewers, the central activity of an AE is to write a meta-review based on the reviews. The reviewers may have opposing views on the merits and the shortcomings of a submission. A good AE will thoroughly read all reviews, will understand the main points of praise and criticism by each of the reviewers, and will instigate the discussion centered around the disagreeing views about the submission's merits. Particularly if there are disagreeing opinions among the reviewers, the AE should also carefully read the paper to be able to lead a meaningful discussion.

Crucially, AEs are encouraged to request from the reviewers to further substantiate and to improve their reviews, if judged to be of insufficient quality. Each review claim, i.e., each point of praise and/or criticism needs to be adequately substantiated. Specifically, AEs need to pay attention to:
* unsubstantiated claims and to blanket statements (e.g., "not novel enough", "too few experiments")
* claims of missing key papers without the relevant citations made by the reviewers
* unjustified/unacceptable reasons for negative evaluation of the submission, listed in the instructions for reviewers (e.g., "this is a resource paper", "the results are not better than SOTA"). 
These are, on their own and without adequate substantiation, not acceptable reasons for negative evaluation of a submission and reviewers should be warned if they resort to those. The AEs are also encouraged to ask reviewers to change their reviews when the review language is hostile, or when the scores do not match the content of the reviews (e.g., low scores but no or little criticism in the review).

The meta-review should aggregate the final position of the reviewers after a thorough discussion (especially in the case of initially opposing views and evaluations): it should summarize the most prominent strengths and weaknesses of the submission and should explicitly judge whether the former outweigh the latter (or vice-versa).

Your overall assessment as an action editor is different from the overall assessments made by the reviewers. Your overall assessment should a) help authors figure out what type of revision (if any) they should aim for, and b) help conference organizers make decisions. You should be signaling, both to the authors and to any program chairs, the amount of work it would take for this paper to be publication ready. So if, for example, many more experiments need to be done, then that probably means a major revision. But if the reviewers’ questions - however many - could be answered simply by adding details to the paper, that probably means a minor revision (which the authors could do between accept and camera ready). This means that a paper may receive a 1, 2, 3 or (rarely) 4 from reviewers, but be a “major revision” (3) from you, or a 4, 3 or (rarely) 2 from reviewers, but be a “minor revision” (4) from you.

Also, of course, you may look across all the reviews and the paper and identify themes or gaps, which may influence your overall assessment. You are an action editor because you are an experienced expert; you do not have to simply average across the reviewers’ scores and summarize their comments.
