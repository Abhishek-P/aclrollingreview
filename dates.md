Within each month, on:
- day 0 - submission deadline
- days 1-4 - action editor assignment
- days 5-7 - desk rejects and reviewer assignment
- days 7-30 - reviewing
- days 30-35 - meta reviewing
- day 35 - reviews to authors

Any paper that is not desk rejected will receive reviews. Once authors have reviews they may:
- revise and resubmit for another round of reviews (typically papers will go back to the same action editor and reviewers)
- submit their paper *and reviews* to a publication venue
