We have **data**. Thanks to great work from Sebastin Santy on our tech team, we now have a regularly updated statistics dashboard for ACL Rolling Review. Check it out at [http://stats.aclrollingreview.org](http://stats.aclrollingreview.org)! When you refer to it, please note the last updated date as data for the current cycles may be somewhat delayed. As always, feedback welcome.
