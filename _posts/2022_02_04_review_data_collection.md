One of the initiatives that ARR supports is the ongoing collection of data about peer-review in NLP. Nils Dycke, Ilia Kuznetsov and Iryna Gurevych have been leading an [ACL-approved initiative](https://www.aclweb.org/adminwiki/index.php?title=Review_Data_Collection_at_*ACL) to collect review data on an opt-in basis. They provide a status update and invite discussion [here](https://openreview.net/forum?id=28n-0nBPTch).
