Starting with the April 15 deadline, there will be a brief period for author response within the ARR review cycle.
* for 5 days after the deadline for regular reviews, authors can make comments on the reviews, using the discussion forum within OpenReview (as is done, for example, with ICLR)
* the comments should be limited to clear factual errors or serious misunderstandings
* reviewers may respond to authors' comments or update their reviews, but are not obligated to do so
* action editors will take these comments into account when writing their metareview

This is made possible by the slightly longer cycle announced in the previous blog post.

The *primary route* for responding to reviews will remain revise and resubmit. In-cycle responses to reviews should not include, for example, new experimental results or data analyses requested by reviewers.
