Starting from the July 2022 ARR cycle, the Reviewers and Action Editors can specify their unavailability and maximum load directly in OpenReview. Load specification is designed as a reviewer/AE task in OpenReview, to be completed before the submission deadline for the respective cycle (for the July 22 cycle, the deadline for specifying the max. load is July 15). A detailed guide on how to declare your max. load / unavailability can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_UEnoQVl27vg-IGyHZlt09nfShZxSofef2GDXo2pipI/edit?usp=sharing).
