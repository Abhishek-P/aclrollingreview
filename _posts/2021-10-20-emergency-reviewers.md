We are recruiting volunteer emergency reviewers and emergency action editors. To volunteer, fill out (*Update: These forms are no longer in use. Please contact the editors to volunteer*):
* Emergency [*action editor* form]()
* Emergency [*reviewer* form]()

**Responsibilities**: 
* As an emergency *action editor*, you will step in at the request of the editors in chief when the action editor assigned to paper is unable to or does not complete their responsibility for a paper. You will chase down reviewers (or find emergency reviewers) and complete a meta review so that authors get their reviews in a timely fashion.
* As an emergency *reviewer*, you will step in at the request of an action editor when the reviewer assigned to paper is unable to or does not complete their responsibility for a paper. You will read a paper and provide a review, probably within a week.

**Availability needed**: You should be available to swing into action between the 10th and 20th of a month. As with other ARR roles, you can indicate your unavailability for any given month(s).

**Level of experience**: You should have all the experience of a regular action editor (publishing regularly in *ACL venues and a demonstrated track record of reviewing for *ACL venues), as well as the ability to focus under time pressure.

In recognition of this extra level of service, ACL Rolling Review will be happy to provide you with a letter of recognition that you can show your employer, as well as displaying your name on our website and acknowledging you at conferences.
