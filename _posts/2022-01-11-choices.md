**There is no need to withdraw any papers from ARR after reviewing is complete** (in fact if you do withdraw your paper from an ARR cycle, we won't be able to transfer that paper + reviews to any venue you "commit" to). Once you have your reviews, your paper is considered to no longer be under review to ARR.

For those of you who have received reviews for any previous ARR cycle and are wondering what your options are, you and your co-authors have a (non-exclusive) choice:
* "commit" your paper + reviews to [ACL 2022](https://openreview.net/group?id=aclweb.org/ACL/2022/Conference) by 15 January 2022 and see if it is accepted (if it is accepted, you could modify the paper before camera ready)
* "commit" your paper + reviews to [NAACL 2022](https://2022.naacl.org/) by 4 March 2022 and see if it is accepted
* *revise your paper* and resubmit it to [ARR](https://openreview.net/group?id=aclweb.org/ACL/ARR/2022) (including to the January 15th 2022 deadline, although that is probably too soon for a revision, practically speaking) to get new reviews. Please see the [call for papers](https://aclrollingreview.org/cfp) for the requirements and options for resubmissions.
* a combination of these is also possible.

If you are interested in "committing" to another venue, please refer to [this page](https://aclrollingreview.org/dates).
