For those of you who have received reviews for any previous ARR cycle and are wondering what your options are, you and your co-authors have a (non-exclusive) choice:
* "commit" your paper + reviews to [ACL 2022](https://openreview.net/group?id=aclweb.org/ACL/2022/Conference) by 15 January 2022 and see if it is accepted (if it is accepted, you could modify the paper before camera ready)
* "commit" your paper + reviews to [NAACL 2022](https://2022.naacl.org/) by 4 March 2022 and see if it is accepted
* *revise your paper* and resubmit it to [ARR](https://openreview.net/group?id=aclweb.org/ACL/ARR/2022) (including to the January 15th 2022 deadline, although that is probably too soon for a revision, practically speaking) to get new reviews. We will try to send your paper back to the original reviewers and metareviewer, if possible, unless you request new reviewers. Resubmissions that are not revised will be returned without review.

If you are interested in "committing" to another venue, please refer to [this page](https://aclrollingreview.org/dates).

There is no need to withdraw any papers from ARR. Once you have your reviews, your paper is considered to no longer be under review to ARR.
