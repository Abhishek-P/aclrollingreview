Action editors and reviewers may now request letters of recognition for their ARR service! Instructions can be found in the:
* [Action editors' guide to OpenReview](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1OynnI8TxlBcSt3J1YCJbxdLsMT91D2Hr1zVtorLkeao/edit#slide=id.p)
* [Reviewers' guide to OpenReview](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1CkfR94WxEPEZEyCN--ydC7K3wY4g-5ZiFd2HM8LRSXg/edit#slide=id.p)

The letter of recognition will be sent to your contact email address as an email attachment at the end of the latest cycle. It will be a PDF, on ARR letterhead, using your preferred name and acknowledging your cumulative number of reviews / metareviews. 

Suggestions for improvements to the wording in the letter of recognition are welcome.

Thanks to Nils Dycke for implementing this new functionality *inside OpenReview*.
