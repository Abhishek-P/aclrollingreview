We are looking for a few extra members of the technical staff, who implement the OpenReview interface, automated systems for reviewer management, paper-reviewer matching, etc. Please contact [cto@aclrollingreview.org](mailto:cto@aclrollingreview.org) with a quick self-introduction if interested!

This is a volunteer position for the ACL academic society, and it will require at most a few hours per week

Contributions can be made in various ways. Even just basic Python coding skills would be useful, but there are also some areas where the ability to write database code or machine learning models would be additionally helpful.
