We're pleased to announce that Malihe Alikhani has accepted to take on the role of Ethics co-chair for ARR. Malihe works towards designing inclusive and equitable language technologies. She develops systems that can communicate and collaborate with diverse populations, especially those from underserved communities. She studies how learning models might become biased and how we can mitigate them. She is currently an assistant professor of computer science at the University of Pittsburgh. Beginning in the Fall of 2023, she will move to Northeastern University.

We're super excited to have you on board, Malihe; welcome!
