For the December cycle, ARR will have a slightly modified timeline. Reviews will be released on January 28th given that reviewing started a bit later due to the end of the semester, the overlapping heavy load from November and the holidays. We also wanted to give a bit more time to AEs to be mindful of weekend days.
* December 15th: Submission deadline
* December 16th-24th: Reviewer/AE assignment
* December 24th-28th: SAC/AE paper check and reassignment
* December 29th-January 18th: Reviewing
* January 19th-27th: Meta-reviews and reviewer chasing
* January 28th: Review and meta-review release
