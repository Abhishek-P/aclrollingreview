One major benefit of ARR is that we can steadily improve the peer review process. Some ideas for these changes come from the ARR team and others came from the community. This page describes what we have done and what we are working on. [This page](./future.md) lists some ideas for future work that have been suggested, and we are considering. 

# Currently in the pipeline

* Developing a workflow for processign reported cases of [publication ethics](https://www.aclweb.org/adminwiki/index.php/ACL_Policy_on_Publication_Ethics) violations with the help of [ACL Publication Ethics Committtee](https://www.aclweb.org/portal/content/acl-publication-ethics-committee-0)
* Improving support of the work by best paper committees
* Improving the ethics review process integration
* Improving reviewed paper information display for SACs
* ARR EiCs participate in the work of [ACL Standing Peer Review Committee](https://www.aclweb.org/portal/content/acl-peer-review-standing-committee), which is currently [considering the core design of the peer review process at ACL](https://www.aclweb.org/portal/content/acl-survey-what-should-acl-peer-review-process-be-future)
* Reviewer history (in development at OpenReview with feedback from venues using OpenReview, including ARR) (lead: Mausam)

# Past improvements (prior to April 2024)

These are some of the ideas that have been implemented since ARR started.

## Process and Policy

* Do not show previous reviews to new reviewers until after they have submitted their review. This avoids biasing their opinion.
* Return to 3 reviews per paper, to reduce reviewing load.
* Create a board to oversee ARR.
* Make requesting new reviewers and/or a new AE for a resubmission easier and have the request be accepted by default.
* Add tracks.
* Ensure there is at least one senior reviewer per paper.
* Ensure that no two reviewers for a paper are from the same research group.
* Focus the review process on *CL conferences only, to make expectations clearer.
* Switch to a longer cycle to ensure all reviews are received on time.
* Introduce author response.
* Introduce senior action editors to help manage the review process.
* Introduce ethics review process.
* Introduce ‘soundness’ to the review form.

## OpenReview UI changes

* Form for AEs to nominate good/bad reviewers.
* Improve and clarify the user interface to encourage more discussion.
* New emergency reviewer tracking and recruitment interface.
* Integrate the responsible research checklist into the submission form.

## Website

* Create clear and complete guides for authors, reviewers, and venue organizers.


## Other

* Dual-submission checking support.
* Extracting service records, to speed up the creation of service certificates.
