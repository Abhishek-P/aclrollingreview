This page contains information about the future of ARR: plans we are working on and suggestions we have received from the community.

# Plans

We are not actively working on changes at the moment.
Our focus is on smoothly running the cycles that lead up to EACL, NAACL, and ACL.
Only critical changes are being made.

# Suggestions

The following ideas have been suggested and may be considered in future ARR development:

### Process changes
- A mentoring system for new reviewers.
- Adding a category of "training" reviewers. Assign them to papers in addition to the normal reviewers. This will help grow the pool of reviewers over time.

### OpenReview UI changes
- Show AE's and SAE's the meta-review scores in the list of papers.
- Show SAEs, AEs, and reviewers the planned schedule in the OpenReview interface.
- A formal way to indicate secondary reviewer contributions.

### Website-related
- Update list of current reviewers, AEs, SAEs, etc.
- Create a public record of who actually did reviewing, etc for each cycle.
- Change Github Issues to have templates for things like a conference that wants to accept submissions (and encourage people to email the tech team instead of posting OR stuff).

### Other
- Create a system that detects low-quality review comments at the sentence level. This could either (a) be shared with reviewers, encouraging them to make changes, or (b) shared with AEs, who can then nudge reviewers.
- Encourage authors of resubmissions to mark up the changes. Maybe do it automatically?
- Automatic checks for length violations.
- Process for SAEs to nominate good/bad AEs.
- Integrating the review system of ARR into Publons so that there is a method for showing reviewing contributions.
- Giving reviewers a way to visualize their individual contributions, e.g. number of reviews completed over time.
- Give authors the ability to download all materials for a paper as a PDF, maintaining anonymisation.

# Implemented Ideas

These are ideas that have been implemented since ARR started:

- Process for AEs to nominate good/bad reviewers.
- Do not show previous reviews to new reviewers until after they have submitted their review. This avoids biasing their opinion.
- Return to 3 reviews per paper, to reduce reviewing load.
- Create a board to oversee ARR.
- Make requesting new reviewers and/or a new AE for a resubmission easier and have the request be accepted by default.
- Add tracks.
- Ensure there is at least one senior reviewer per paper.
- Ensure that no two reviewers for a paper are from the same research group.
- Focus the review process on \*CL conferences only, to make expectations clearer.
- Switch to a longer cycle to ensure all reviews are received on time.
- Improve and clarify the user interface to encourage more discussion.
- Introduce author response.
- Introduce senior action editors to help manage the review process.
- Introduce ethics review process.
- Introduce 'soundness' to the review form.
