This page describes some ideas that have been proposed by the community, and that we are considering for the future.


# Planned Future Work

* An author feedback mechanism not only for reviewers, but also ACs (for action by SACs)
* Enabling the joint track work by all track SACs
* Improving the workflow to pass reviewed papers to other conferences/workshops
* Improving the integration with proceedings generation
* Reviewer profiles with service history (in development at OpenReview)
* Create a public record of who actually did reviewing, etc for each cycle.
* Using ACL Pub Check to assist PCs with desk reject identification

# Suggestions

The following ideas have been suggested and may be considered in future ARR development:

## Process and Policy

* Adding a category of “training” reviewers. Assign them to papers in addition to the normal reviewers. This will help grow the pool of reviewers over time.
* A new type of desk reject, disallowing resubmission (for some rare cases of procedural violations)

## OpenReview UI

* Show AEs and SAEs the meta-review scores in the list of papers.
* Show SAEs, AEs, and reviewers the planned schedule in the OpenReview interface.
* A formal way to indicate secondary reviewer contributions.
* Give authors the ability to download all materials for a paper as a PDF, maintaining anonymisation.
* Mechanism for SAEs to nominate good/bad AEs.

## Website

* On the stats page, show resubmission stats as distributions rather than with box plots (at the moment it is hard to see what the median is).

## Other

* A mentoring system for new reviewers.
* An interactive tutorial for reviewers
* Create a system that detects low-quality review comments at the sentence level. This could either (a) be shared with reviewers, encouraging them to make changes, or (b) shared with AEs, who can then nudge reviewers.
* Encourage authors of resubmissions to mark up the changes. Maybe do it automatically?
* Automatic checks for length violations.
* Integrating the review system of ARR into OrcID so that there is a method for showing reviewing contributions.
