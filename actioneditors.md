ACL Rolling Review offers:
* follow a paper from initial submission through to eventual acceptance
* manage your action editor load month over month
* advanced reviewer/paper matching

## What are the responsibilities of an action editor?

Each month, after the submission deadline, action editors will be automatically assigned up to 5 submissions. The action editor will first confirm they have no conflict of interest with each submission. Then, they will quickly check the submission for any major violations in formatting or other factors and desk reject the submission if it is in violation. The action editor will then be presented with a list of reviewers automatically suggested. The action editor will choose reviewers, using this automatic suggestion as a base. This will take place within 7 days of the paper submission deadline.

Each month, starting around 24 days after the submission deadline, the action editor will remind any reviewer who has not yet completed their review.

Each month, between 30 and 35 days after the submission deadline, the action editor will read the reviews, discuss with the reviewers if necessary, and:
* Summarize the review results in a meta-review.
* Perform a compliance check, checking several boxes confirming “the paper satisfies the formatting requirements (e.g. abiding by the page limit),” “the paper is written in comprehensible English (or any language accepted by *ACL publications),” “the paper is compliant with the ACL ethical code,” “the paper is topically within the scope of at least one *ACL venue.” In the very rare case (e.g. 2-4% of submitted papers?) that a paper does not satisfy these minimal criteria, it will not be allowed to proceed to the next step and may face a moratorium on resubmission for a certain period of time.

## What is the time commitment for action editors?
An initial term of one year, renewable. If an action editor will be unavailable in any given month, they should notify the editors in chief.
