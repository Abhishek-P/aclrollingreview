ACL Rolling Review offers:
* follow a paper from initial submission through to eventual acceptance
* manage your action editor load month over month

## What are the responsibilities of an action editor?

Each month, after the submission deadline, action editors will be automatically assigned up to 5 submissions. The action editor will first confirm they have no conflict of interest with each submission. Then, they will quickly check the submission for any major violations in formatting or other factors and desk reject the submission if it is in violation. The action editor will then be presented with a list of reviewers automatically suggested. The action editor will choose reviewers, using this automatic suggestion as a base. This will take place within 7 days of the paper submission deadline.

Each month, starting around 24 days after the submission deadline, the action editor will remind any reviewer who has not yet completed their review.

Each month, between 30 and 35 days after the submission deadline, the action editor will read the reviews, discuss with the reviewers if necessary, and:
* Summarize the review results in a meta-review.
* Perform a compliance check, checking the paper meetings formatting and other requirements.

So, action editors will want to be especially available from the 10th to the 20th of each month.

## What is the time commitment for action editors?
An initial term of one year, renewable. If an action editor will be unavailable in any given month, they should notify the editors in chief.
